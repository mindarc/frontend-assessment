### Exercise 1 - Steps

+ Init Vue project
+ Clean up the base of project
  --> Build layout
>  #### NB.
> Would be nice to have Figma design or similar online service for the exercise designs! ::) \
> I don't have PhotoShop installed, so using Chrome extensions for ~ measuring and color-picking
> 
> Provided background images are much lighter than design mockup. I would ask a designer now, if we need to put
  semitransparent overlay over the images. Leaving them as they are for now.
  
#### build components
* PageTitle
* Card
* Button

>  #### NB.
> We can split the design into more granular components if we find that useful for the project. Eg. Hero, VText,
  VLink, etc

#### css
* custom font Inter - just to show that it is possible (and because I don't have exact requirement on font atm)
* use vars. calc
* flexbox

### ToDo next: Exercise 2 - Steps, will continue on Sunday, 12.02

--> Read data

### Nice to add

* Tests - Vue-test-utils
* LESS\SCSS for styles
* Buttons - dynamic classes for diff styles
