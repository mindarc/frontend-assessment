## Answer to Bonus Question
The expression ('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase() when evaluated follows a sequence: first, concatenating the strings 'b' and 'a' that results in 'ba'. Then, converting the string 'a' to a number by using the unary plus (+) resulting to a NaN (Not-a-Number). This NaN value is changed into a string when concatenated with 'ba', leading to 'baNaN'. Finally, adding 'a' to 'baNaN' resulting to 'baNaNa'. Calling .toLowerCase() on this string converts all characters to lowercase, showing the value as 'banana'.
