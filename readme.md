 ```
 - The plus sign before the second 'a' makes the code coerces a string to a number which will return a NaN (not a number),
 - Normally 'b' + 'a' + 'a' + 'a' will just return 'baaa', but because of the plus sign before the second a it returns a baNaNa,
 - '.toLowerCase()' transforms the string to lowercase including na NaN.
