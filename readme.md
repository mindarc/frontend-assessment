Thank you for this exercises, I really had fun doing this, I don't really have background in VueJS but I decided to use the
library as I wanted to learn about it anyway. So here's my answer for the exercises 1 and 2. Had a bit of trouble and realization when I was building it and a lot of wow moments as well. Anyway had a fun doing this.

## Exercise 1

In the root of `/exercise1` run

```
npm install
```

to install Vue dependencies and other library

To run application locally run

```
npm run dev
```

then go to http://127.0.0.1:5173/

##### Assets

- provided links for the assests are not working anymore, and I'm having an error page when visiting the url, so I decided to get in around that internet for similar image / placeholder. Hope that's okay.

## Exercise 2

In the root of `/exercise2` run

```
npm install
```

to install Vue dependencies and other library

To run application locally run

```
npm run dev
```

then go to http://127.0.0.1:5173/

###### Bonus points

- Improve the user experience with meaningful animations/transitions.
- Design and styling.
- Explain why the result of `('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase()` is `banana`.

Upon checking this here `'a' + + 'a'` it results to `Nan` and that's why end result is `banana` üçå
