This is my submission for these tasks. 

Exercise 1
---
I build a responsive page according to the designs provided. I had to quickly learn SaSS for my CSS because I wanted to show my ability to learn new things and implementing it. 

Exercise 2
---
I fetch the data from the json file and used string literal to create all the tags and attributes needed to create a responsive Tab and Accordions.

Thank you for you time.
