Thank you for having me for here.

Explain why the result of ('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase() is banana ?

Answer:

When we try to read the above condition. 

First  JavaScript tries to convert the '+a' to numerical and since its a numberical value
it returns 'NaN'.
('b' + 'a' + NaN + 'a')

Second, The JavaScript concatenates  the single '+' sign.

-> so  in simple term we have 'baNaNa'
-> Thirdly toLowerCase() bring everything to lower case.

-> Finally we have 'banana'
